    <p>1k Watts, rapper and poet, was born and raised in Bakersfield, CA. 
        His influences include Mac Miller, Wiz Khalifa, Robert Bukowski, and Vincent Van Gogh. 
        1k Watts has released nurmerous singles featuring artists such as Stitches, Sir Michael Rocks, and Dizzy Wright to name a few. 
        In what felt like an overnight dream, he started a stoner movement from his Marijuana related music to his critically acclaimed Youtube Channel. 
        With the power of his movement, 1k has toured many cities around the world, from opening acts for major artists such as Soulja Boy, Waka Flocka Flame, Riff Raff, and Mike G of Odd Future 
        to selling out classic venues such as the Whisky a Go Go and the Roxy.
